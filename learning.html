  <div class="desc">The Use of Biometrics in Schools</div>
  <p>The introduction of biometric systems in schools has helped to streamline the education and enhance discipline.
      Facial recognition, fingerprints, voice recognition, and eye tracking are some of the biometric methods that schools
      have implemented to streamline their operations. Apart from being used to monitor a student’s class attendance, they are
      used when borrowing school properties such as books in the library. Teachers use eye tracking methods to monitor how students
      are absorbing content that they have been taught.</p>

  <div class="desc">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</div>
  <p>AI now is the "in thing" in the US EdTech market.
      AI can automate basic activities in education, like grading. It’s now possible for teachers to automate grading of the multiple-choice
      and fill-in-the-blank questions. Thus, automated grading of students’ writing may not be far behind.
    Furthermore, both learners and educators could benefit from AI. For example, students could get help from AI tutors when teachers are too
    busy to take care of everyone. Also, AI-driven programs can give both learners and educators helpful feedback. That’s why some schools
    use AI systems to monitor student progress and to alert teachers when there might be an issue with students’ performances. </p>

  <div class="desc">STEAM</div>
  <p>STEAM-based programs are the new EdTech improvement over the STEM programs. This new trend of EdTech applies meaningful Science, Technology,
      Engineering, Art (the new element), and Math content to solve real-world problems through hands-on learning activities and creative design.
    Concerning the advantages of STEAM, the first thing is that it helps students become increasingly curious about the world around them.
    Moreover, it also creates a safe environment for the learners to express and experience their ideas while thinking outside the box.
    The comfort of hands-on learning also helps students collaborate better with others.</p>
