  <div class="desc">The Use of Biometrics in Schools</div>
  <p>The introduction of biometric systems in schools has helped to streamline the education and enhance discipline.
      Facial recognition, fingerprints, voice recognition, and eye tracking are some of the biometric methods that schools
      have implemented to streamline their operations. Apart from being used to monitor a student’s class attendance, they are
      used when borrowing school properties such as books in the library. Teachers use eye tracking methods to monitor how students
      are absorbing content that they have been taught.

    Widespread access of the Internet is one factor that has accelerated the implementation of technological innovations in the education sector.
    Ideas spread fast and people can research the best methods for using technology in education.
    Hardware companies are producing devices such as laptops and tablets which are customized to meet specific education needs.

  <div class="desc">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</div>
  <p>AI now is the "in thing" in the US EdTech market. People have predicted that through 2021, AI could become the primary trend and grow by more than 45%. So why is the trend booming in one of the world’s largest markets for EdTech? First and foremost, AI can automate basic activities in education, like grading. It’s now possible for teachers to automate grading of the multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. Thus, automated grading of students’ writing may not be far behind.

    Furthermore, both learners and educators could benefit from AI. For example, students could get help from AI tutors when teachers are too busy to take care of everyone. Also, AI-driven programs can give both learners and educators helpful feedback. That’s why some schools use AI systems to monitor student progress and to alert teachers when there might be an issue with students’ performances. Therefore, it’s not too far fetched that AI is a powerful assistant for in-class teaching. Meanwhile, why don’t you help your learners get more out of the educational experience via AI?</p>

  <div class="desc">STEAM</div>
  <p>STEAM-based programs are the new EdTech improvement over the STEM programs. This new trend of EdTech applies meaningful Science, Technology, Engineering, Art (the new element), and Math content to solve real-world problems through hands-on learning activities and creative design.

    Concerning the advantages of STEAM, the first thing is that it helps students become increasingly curious about the world around them. Moreover, it also creates a safe environment for the learners to express and experience their ideas while thinking outside the box. The comfort of hands-on learning also helps students collaborate better with others.</p>
