  <div class="desc">Digital Twin</div>
  <p>A digital twin is another developing IoT trend and what it does is exactly as you might expect. It is a virtual asset that corresponds directly with a physical object. This allows for the object to be thoroughly tested digitally before it is implemented into the real world. Using real world data, a Digital twin can provide accurate simulations of how the program would function in the real world without risking security or resources by demoing it on a live service. A digital twin is an emerging Internet of Things technology that is useful for saving money as well as for testing. Digital twin technology may benefit the manufacturing, automatitive, and healthcare industries by allowing them to check production processes, model traffic conditions, and work to predict patients’ health based on comparing vitals digitally – all in real-time.</p>

  <div class="desc">Edge Computing</div>
  <p>Edge computing allows for us to get shorter response time and save bandwidth. Edge computing considerably reduces the amount of data to be transmitted, the traffic, and the distance this data has to travel. Edge computing will shorten the trip for data by placing the user closer toward the data or server that they actually need to be using.

    In the age of Big Data, which is huge amounts of information that grows exponentially, there is seemingly limitless data being created, the physical infrastructure can only handle so much at a time. Edge computing will allow for less frequent slow-downs in speed when many users are using the network at the same time. This type of IoT technology will help with processes deliveries and self-driving vehicles.</p>

  <div class="desc">Smart Home and Customer Assistance</div>
  <p>One of the IoT trends that will keep expanding is the use of IoT devices in the home and in daily interactions. We continue to become accustomed to interacting with virtual assistants in our daily lives – from assistants found within the screen to hardware interfaces we might see at the local shopping center or bank. Virtual assistants can be present in different forms like a voice-activated assistant on your phone or a chatbot on your favorite brand’s website. The function of these digital assistants is to help us find information, solve problems, verify our identity, and even perform real-world functions like ordering a pizza. Within ‘smart homes’, we will see virtual assistants, in the form of smart devices, adjust and learn your habits. Your thermostat will learn that you like to heat the house in the morning during colder days and will begin doing that automatically for you. Smart homes with IoT tech will allow smart-lightbulbs, heating and cooling systems, and other household appliances to optimize for your preferred conditions.
