  <div class="desc">The Use of Next-Generation Computing Technology</div>
  <p>In medicine, for example, the ability to analyze large data sets helps drugmakers identify treatments based on the cause of a disease. This has the potential to reduce the $2.6 billion price tag and the 90 percent failure rate for developing new drugs.  

    In addition, the evolution of cloud computing technology has removed a barrier for many innovations in biotech. The ability to run applications through the cloud allows companies to store and analyze data without buying expensive computer hardware. This benefits early-stage startups, which try to limit operating expenses as much as possible, but it also helps larger and more established companies, as it makes it easier and cheaper to allocate resources for new projects.</p>

  <div class="desc">The Evolution of Clinical Trials </div>
  <p>Today, the clinical trial has been heavily digitized, enabling biotech companies to test treatments on more patients in less time. In a notable example, in November 2019 the medical genetics company known as Invitae announced a trial with Apple Watch that brings together biometric data collected from the wristwatch and the results of genetic tests in an effort to determine the genes that cause cardiovascular disease. This makes the trial accessible to a larger number of people, and it helps researchers quickly exclude patients who do not meet the criteria for the trial.

    As noted, machine learning technology also holds promise for the future of the clinical trial. Biotech companies can quickly analyze data from current trials to predict the effectiveness of treatments down to a molecular level; they can also revisit data from previous trials to see if anything may have been missed, or if there may be new or different uses for an existing drug.</p>

  <div class="desc">Growth in Personalized Treatment of Rare Diseases</div>
  <p>The reduced cost of genetic sequencing—from $2.7 billion for the Human Genome Project in 1990 to less than $300 today, and potentially less than $100 in the near future—allows for much more extensive screening of trial participants and targeting of interventions. This has enabled the development of personalized treatment plans and targeted therapies, which are more effective than less-specific therapies because they focus on a patient’s genetic and molecular makeup.

    Cancer treatment is a key area of focus for targeted therapies. One prominent example is blood cancer such as leukemia, where a treatment called CAR T-cell therapy targets a patient’s immune cells and, in the words of the National Cancer Institute, the immune system will “attack tumors.”</p>

<p>Advancing in the Biotechnology Industry 
  These trends in biotechnology show that today’s biotech professionals need more than just a background in biology, chemistry, or pharmaceutical science to advance their careers. Business skills are critical for managing a research project or technical team, while technology expertise can add real-time analysis to cutting-edge research and development. </p>
