  <div class="desc">Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 Test</div>
  <p>Abbott’s ID NOW system has helped physicians detect influenzas A and B, strep A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
    and most recently SARS-CoV-2, in less than 15 minutes. The toaster-size device works by heating nasal samples in an
    acidic solution that cracks open the envelope of the viruses, exposing their RNA, which ID NOW amplifies at a constant
    temperature instead of the heating and cooling cycles that PCR machines use.
    With more than 23,000 ID NOW devices in use in the US, mainly in urgent care clinics and pharmacies, Moore says his team
    is developing tests compatible with the platform for other infectious diseases, such as sexually transmitted infections.</p>

  <div class="desc">AbCellera Celium™ </div>
  <p>Celium is a data visualization tool that intersects more than a million high-quality data points for those
    antibodies to reveal which ones might work best in patients as a potential therapy.

    Before Celium came on the market in 2017, scientists working with AbCellera to find antibodies would get back
    complex spreadsheets of data that were difficult to navigate, and it was hard to know where to start, Smith says.
    Using Celium, data are presented in a visual format and the tool “helps you identify the right molecule for your needs,”
    Fernando Corrêa, a protein engineer at Kodiak Sciences in Palo Alto, California tells The Scientist. He’s partnered with
    AbCellera to identify antibodies to treat retinal diseases, and says the company’s package of microfluidics, single-cell
    analysis, and data visualization tool “streamlines the process of antibody discovery in a user-friendly manner.”

  <div class="desc">OXGENE TESSA</div>
  <p>A central challenge to delivering gene therapies to patients’ cells is the cost of making adeno-associated virus (AAV),
    a common vector for genes of interest, says Ryan Cawood, CEO of UK-based biotech company OXGENE.
    “The first AAV gene therapy product that was approved in the EU cost a million pounds per dose,” he says.
    “If you wanted to treat a disease [with a therapy targeting a large organ] that you could apply to thousands
    of people, you just simply couldn’t make enough of it at a cost that would make it viable.”

    To get around this issue, OXGENE devised a genetic switch that shuts down an adenovirus’s activity halfway through its life
    cycle within a cell, so that it programs the cell to churn out AAV particles but not to make adenovirus. </p>

<p>Advancing in the Biotechnology Industry 
  These trends in biotechnology show that today’s biotech professionals need more than just a background
  in biology, chemistry, or pharmaceutical science to advance their careers. Business skills are critical
  for managing a research project or technical team, while technology expertise can add real-time analysis
  to cutting-edge research and development. </p>
