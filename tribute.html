         <p>"There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Why do you want to live? What's the point? <br>
          What inspires you? What do you love about the future? If the future does not include being out there among the stars and being<br>
          a multi-planet species, I find that incredibly depressing."</p>
